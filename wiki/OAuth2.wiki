#summary OAuth 2.0 in the client library

= Overview =

[http://oauth.net/2/ OAuth 2.0] is an emerging standard for
accessing protected resources on the web. Google APIs and the 
google-api-php-client library support OAuth 2.0. 

== Further Reading ==

  * For details about how OAuth 2.0 works in the client library, read the [http://code.google.com/p/google-api-php-client/wiki/AuthenticationDesignDoc#OAuth_2.0 Design Document].
  * For general information about OAuth 2.0, see the [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2 OAuth 2.0 draft specification].

= Registering =

Before you can use OAuth 2.0, you must register your application using the  [https://code.google.com/apis/console/ Google APIs Console]. After you've registered, go to the API Access tab and copy the "Client ID" and "Client secret" values, which you'll need later.

If you're writing a web application, then make sure the Redirect URI matches the URI you will use in your application to 
handle the redirect. For example, the sample below uses the path
`/auth_return`, so if the sample application were hosted at example.com, then
you would set the Redirect URI in the APIs Console to be `http://example.com/auth_return`.
